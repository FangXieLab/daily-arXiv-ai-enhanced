Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

They admit closed-form expressions for densities and many functionals of interest, making them attractive for practical applications. However, the complex conditions on the dependence parameters to ensure that Sarmanov copulas are valid limit their application in high dimensions. Verifying the $d$-increasing property typically requires satisfying a combinatorial set of inequalities that makes direct construction difficult. To circumvent this issue, we develop a stochastic representation for bivariate Sarmanov copulas. We prove that every admissible Sarmanov can be realized as a mixture of independent univariate distributions indexed by a latent Bernoulli pair. The stochastic representation replaces the problem of verifying copula validity with the problem of ensuring nonnegativity of a Bernoulli probability mass function. The representation also recovers classical copula families, including Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern, Huang--Kotz, and Bairamov--Kotz--Bekçi as special cases. We further derive sharp global bounds for Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. We then introduce a Bernoulli-mixing construction in higher dimensions, leading to a new class of multivariate Sarmanov copulas with easily verifiable parameter constraints and scalable simulation algorithms. Finally, we show that powered versions of bivariate Sarmanov copulas admit a similar stochastic representation through block-maximal order statistics."}

The resulting power posterior - also known as an $α$-posterior or fractional posterior - has been shown to exhibit appealing properties, including robustness to model misspecification and asymptotic normality (Bernstein-von Mises theorem). However, practical recommendations for selecting the tempering parameter and statistical guarantees for the resulting power posterior remain open questions. Cross-validation-based approaches to tuning this parameter suggest interesting asymptotic regimes for the selected $α$, which can either vanish or behave like a mixture distribution with a point mass at infinity and the remaining mass converging to zero. We formalize the asymptotic properties of the power posterior in these regimes. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for (i) consistency of the power posterior moments and (ii) asymptotic normality of the power posterior mean. Our analysis required us to establish a new Laplace approximation that is interesting in its own right and is the key technical tool for showing a critical threshold $α\\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$ where the asymptotic normality of the posterior mean breaks. Our results allow for the power to depend on the data in an arbitrary way."}

This framework yields a well-defined functional form encompassing the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means, among others.\n  In this article, we uncover an elegant connection between two key results of Kolmogorov by showing that the class of regular means can be derived directly from the Kolmogorov superposition theorem. This connection is conceptually appealing and illustrates that the superposition theorem deserves wider recognition in Statistics -- not only because of its link to regular means as shown here, but also due to its influence on the development of neural models and its potential connections with other statistical frameworks. In addition, we establish a stability property of regular means, showing that they vary smoothly under small perturbations of the generator. Finally, we provide insights into a recent universal central limit theorem that applies to the broad class of regular means."}

Our primary methodological contribution is a particle learning algorithm for sequential inference, in which the filter is propagated forward in time while tracking only sufficient statistics. We also discuss how HS-MoE relates to modern mixture-of-experts layers in large language models, which are deployed under extreme sparsity constraints (e.g., activating a small number of experts per token out of a large pool)."}
