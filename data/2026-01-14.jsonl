In this paper, we study D-OCO under unknown, time-and agent-varying feedback delays. While recent work has addressed this problem (Nguyen et al., 2024), existing algorithms assume prior knowledge of the total delay over agents and still suffer from suboptimal dependence on both the delay and network parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves an improved regret bound of O N $\\sqrt$ d tot + N $\\sqrt$ T  (1-$σ$2) 1/4 , where T is the total horizon, d tot denotes the average total delay across agents, N is the number of agents, and 1 -$σ$ 2 is the spectral gap of the network. Our approach builds upon recent advances in D-OCO (Wan et al., 2024a), but crucially incorporates an adaptive learning rate mechanism via a decentralized communication protocol. This enables each agent to estimate delays locally using a gossip-based strategy without the prior knowledge of the total delay. We further extend our framework to the strongly convex setting and derive a sharper regret bound of O N $δ$max ln T $α$  , where $α$ is the strong convexity parameter and $δ$ max is the maximum number of missing observations averaged over agents. We also show that our upper bounds for both settings are tight up to logarithmic factors. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing improvements over existing benchmark algorithms."}

The recent success of deep neural networks and foundation models has now given rise to a new paradigm in statistical modeling, in which Bayesian inference can be amortized through large-scale learned predictors. In amortized inference, substantial computation is invested upfront to train a neural network that can subsequently produce approximate posterior or predictions at negligible marginal cost across a wide range of tasks. At deployment, amortized inference offers substantial computational savings compared with traditional Bayesian procedures, which generally require repeated likelihood evaluations or Monte Carlo simulations for predictions for each new dataset.\n  Despite the growing popularity of amortized inference, its statistical interpretation and its role within Bayesian inference remain poorly understood. This paper presents statistical perspectives on the working principles of several major neural architectures, including feedforward networks, Deep Sets, and Transformers, and examines how these architectures naturally support amortized Bayesian inference. We discuss how these models perform structured approximation and probabilistic reasoning in ways that yield controlled generalization error across a wide range of deployment scenarios, and how these properties can be harnessed for Bayesian computation. Through simulation studies, we evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and uncertainty quantification of amortized inference under varying signal-to-noise ratios and distributional shifts, highlighting both its strengths and its limitations."}

Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning."}

To this end, we propose a new combinatorial structure in directed acyclic graphs called the directed convex hull, which has turned out to be equivalent to their minimum localized Bayesian networks. An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has high dimension reduction capability in real networks, and the efficiency of probabilistic inference based on directed convex hulls can be significantly improved compared with traditional methods such as variable elimination and belief propagation algorithms.

Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches."}

Lillo"], "title": "On the use of graph models to achieve individual and group fairness", "comment": "75 pages, 46 figures", "summary": "Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts such as justice, healthcare and finance, which has spawned a great demand for fairness in these procedures. However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs."}
